    This is a reupload because the module\u2019s maintainer has changed. Players who
    were subscribed to the old (buggy) version will still have that version on their
    system. To delete it, search your Steam folder for \u201C753762370\u201D and delete
    the folder with that name.[/h1]\r\n\r\n[url=http://ktane.timwi.de/PDF/Silly%20Slots.pdf]Manual
